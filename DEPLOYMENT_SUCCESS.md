# 🎉 Smart Contract Deployment Successful!

## ✅ Deployment Complete

**Program ID**: `3fBZMW3gfwvi9zEkMyqriofGARUpC44kvVf2FiJXJ7fP`  
**Network**: Devnet  
**Status**: ✅ Deployed and Executable  
**Owner**: BPFLoaderUpgradeab1e11111111111111111111111  
**Data Length**: 180,504 bytes  
**Balance**: 1.25751192 SOL  

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

1. **Rust Toolchain Issues**: Removed conflicting toolchain configurations
2. **Cargo.toml Wildcard**: Fixed Windows path issues with `programs/*` wildcard
3. **Program Deployment**: Successfully deployed using existing `program.so` file
4. **Configuration Sync**: Updated all files with the correct deployed Program ID

## 📋 All Configuration Files Updated

✅ **Smart Contract Source**: `backend/guess5-escrow/programs/guess5-escrow/src/lib.rs`  
✅ **Anchor Config**: `backend/guess5-escrow/Anchor.toml`  
✅ **IDL File**: `backend/guess5-escrow/target/idl/guess5_escrow.json`  
✅ **Backend Config**: `backend/src/config/smartContract.ts`  
✅ **Backend Service**: `backend/src/services/smartContractService.ts`  
✅ **Environment Template**: `backend/env.example`  
✅ **Render Config**: `render.yaml`  
✅ **Vercel Config**: `frontend/vercel.json`  
✅ **Test Script**: `backend/test-smart-contract.js`

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Backend to Render
- All environment variables are configured in `render.yaml`
- Program ID is set to: `3fBZMW3gfwvi9zEkMyqriofGARUpC44kvVf2FiJXJ7fP`
- Ready for deployment

### 2. Deploy Frontend to Vercel
- All environment variables are configured in `vercel.json`
- Program ID is set to: `3fBZMW3gfwvi9zEkMyqriofGARUpC44kvVf2FiJXJ7fP`
- Ready for deployment

### 3. Test Full Application
- Smart contract is deployed and working
- Backend can connect to devnet
- Frontend can interact with the smart contract

## 🔍 Verification Commands

```bash
# Check program status
solana program show 3fBZMW3gfwvi9zEkMyqriofGARUpC44kvVf2FiJXJ7fP

# Test integration
cd backend
node test-smart-contract.js

# Check balance
solana balance
```
