## **🎯 Tips for Best Experience**

### **Before Playing:**
1. **Get plenty of devnet SOL** (at least 1 SOL)
2. **Use popular entry fees** (0.1 SOL, 0.05 SOL)
3. **Have stable internet** - game is time-sensitive

### **During Matchmaking:**
1. **Be patient** - wait for other players
2. **Don't refresh** - let the system work
3. **Keep wallet connected** - don't disconnect Phantom

### **During Escrow:**
1. **Review transaction carefully** - check amount and recipient
2. **Don't close Phantom** - wait for confirmation
3. **Don't refresh page** - let process complete

## **💰 Understanding the Economics**

### **Entry Fee Examples:**
- **0.05 SOL** = ~$1.25 (small stakes)
- **0.1 SOL** = ~$2.50 (medium stakes)
- **0.2 SOL** = ~$5.00 (higher stakes)

### **Payout Structure:**
- **Winner gets 90%** of total pot
- **Platform gets 10%** as fee
- **Example:** 0.1 SOL entry fee each = 0.2 SOL total pot
  - Winner gets: 0.18 SOL (90%)
  - Platform gets: 0.02 SOL (10%)

### **Gas Fees:**
- **Devnet:** Very low (negligible)
- **Mainnet:** ~0.000005 SOL per transaction
- **Included in entry fee** - no extra charges
