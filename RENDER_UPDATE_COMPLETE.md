## ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Action Required

**MCP cannot remove environment variables**, so you need to manually remove these old/unused ones from the Render dashboard:

### Variables to Delete (Manual):
1. ‚ùå `FEE_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SECURITY RISK!**
2. ‚ùå `RESULTS_ATTESTOR_ADDRESS` (old PDA system)
3. ‚ùå `RESULTS_ATTESTOR_PUBKEY` (old PDA system)
4. ‚ùå `SMART_CONTRACT_PROGRAM_ID` (old PDA system)

### How to Remove:
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d21t8m3ipnbc73fscgsg/environment
2. Find each variable listed above
3. Click the delete/trash icon next to each one
4. Confirm deletion

## üîí Security Alert

**`FEE_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` is still exposed and active!**

This is a **critical security vulnerability**. If this private key is leaked, an attacker can drain your fee wallet. 

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediately** remove `FEE_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` from environment variables
2. Generate a new fee wallet for future transactions
3. Transfer any remaining funds from the old fee wallet to the new one
4. Never store private keys in environment variables again

- ‚úÖ All required environment variables added
- ‚úÖ New deployment triggered
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Old variables still present (need manual removal)
