# Solana Integration Complete ✅

## Overview
All mock code has been removed and replaced with real Solana transaction handling. The system is now ready for devnet testing with real SOL.

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Deposit Verification** (`multisigVaultService.verifyDeposit`)
**Before:** Returned fake transaction IDs  
**Now:** 
- Checks actual Solana balance using `connection.getBalance()`
- Verifies both players' deposits have been received
- Updates match status when deposits confirmed
- Sets match to 'READY' when both deposits are present

### 2. **Payout Transactions** (`multisigVaultService.processPayout`)
**Before:** Created fake transaction ID string  
**Now:**
- Creates real Solana `Transaction` objects
- Uses `SystemProgram.transfer` for actual fund transfers
- Signs transaction with vault keypair
- Sends to Solana using `connection.sendRawTransaction()`
- Waits for confirmation
- Returns real transaction signature

**Payout Amounts:**
- Winner receives: 95% of total pot
- Fee wallet receives: 5% of total pot

### 3. **Refund Transactions** (`multisigVaultService.processRefund`)
**Before:** Created fake refund ID  
**Now:**
- Creates real Solana transaction
- Refunds both players their full entry fee
- Signs and sends to Solana
- Returns real transaction signature

### 4. **Vault Status Checking** (`multisigVaultService.checkVaultStatus`)
**Before:** Returned mock balance (0.2 SOL)  
**Now:**
- Queries actual Solana account balance
- Gets recent slot number
- Returns real balance in lamports and SOL

### 5. **Deposit Watcher Service** (`depositWatcherService`)
**Updated:**
- Now calls `multisigVaultService.verifyDeposit()` for real verification
- Polls every 10 seconds for pending deposits
- Automatically updates match status when deposits confirmed

## Technical Details

### Vault Keypair Generation
Vault keypairs are deterministically generated from match ID:
```typescript
const vaultSeed = Buffer.from(`vault_${matchId}`);
const vaultKeypair = Keypair.fromSeed(vaultSeed.subarray(0, 32));
```
This ensures the same vault address for the same match every time.

### Transaction Flow

#### Deposit Flow:
1. Player sends SOL to vault address from their wallet
2. `DepositWatcherService` polls every 10 seconds
3. `verifyDeposit()` checks Solana balance
4. When both deposits confirmed, match status → 'READY'

#### Payout Flow:
1. Game ends, winner determined
2. KMS signs attestation
3. `processPayout()` creates Solana transaction
4. Transaction includes:
   - Transfer to winner (95%)
   - Transfer to fee wallet (5%)
5. Transaction signed by vault keypair
6. Sent to Solana and confirmed
7. Real transaction signature saved to database

#### Refund Flow:
1. Match times out or error occurs
2. `processRefund()` creates Solana transaction
3. Transaction includes:
   - Refund to player 1 (full entry fee)
   - Refund to player 2 (full entry fee)
4. Transaction signed and sent
5. Real transaction signature saved

## Ready for Devnet Testing ✅

The system is now fully functional with:
- ✅ Real Solana deposit verification
- ✅ Real Solana payout transactions
- ✅ Real Solana refund transactions
- ✅ Real balance checking
- ✅ No mock code remaining

## Testing on Devnet

### Prerequisites:
1. Get devnet SOL from faucet: https://faucet.solana.com
2. Deploy backend to Render
3. Deploy frontend to Vercel
4. Ensure AWS KMS credentials are set in Render environment variables

### Test Flow:
1. Player 1 connects wallet and requests match
2. Player 2 connects wallet and requests match
3. Match is created with unique vault address
4. Both players deposit SOL to vault address
5. Deposits are verified (polled every 10 seconds)
6. Game starts when both deposits confirmed
7. Players play Wordle independently
8. Winner is determined
9. Real payout transaction sent to Solana
10. Winner receives 95% of pot in their wallet
11. Fee wallet receives 5%

### Viewing Transactions:
All transactions can be viewed on Solana Explorer:
- Devnet: https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet
- Search by transaction signature
