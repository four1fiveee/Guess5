# Smart Contract Deployment Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Project Cleanup** - Removed 40+ unnecessary files
2. **Program ID Extraction** - `F2Bvxq5bucMFdxAXrwRQd2vGoXdJuddgdPkHwmU3wVx4`
3. **Configuration Updates**:
   - ‚úÖ Smart contract source code (`lib.rs`)
   - ‚úÖ Anchor configuration (`Anchor.toml`)
   - ‚úÖ IDL file with correct Program ID
   - ‚úÖ Backend services (`smartContractService.ts`, `smartContract.ts`)
   - ‚úÖ Deployment configs (`render.yaml`, `frontend/vercel.json`)
4. **Tool Installation**:
   - ‚úÖ Rust toolchain in WSL
   - ‚úÖ Solana CLI v1.18.26 in WSL
   - ‚úÖ Anchor CLI v0.29.0 in WSL
   - ‚úÖ Solana BPF tools downloaded and extracted
5. **Documentation Created**:
   - ‚úÖ `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
   - ‚úÖ `WSL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - WSL-specific instructions
   - ‚úÖ `backend/env.example` - Environment variable template
   - ‚úÖ `backend/test-smart-contract.js` - Test script
   - ‚úÖ `backend/deploy-existing-program.js` - Alternative deployment script

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue

The `anchor build` command is failing due to environment issues in WSL. The error "No such file or directory (os error 2)" suggests missing dependencies or PATH issues.

## üîß Solutions

### Option 1: Fix WSL Environment (Recommended)

The Solana BPF tools are installed but there are PATH/environment issues. Try these commands in WSL:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/henry/OneDrive/Desktop/Guess5/backend/guess5-escrow

# Set up environment
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
export HOME="/home/four1five"

# Try building
anchor build
```

### Option 2: Use Windows PowerShell

If WSL continues to have issues, try from Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\henry\OneDrive\Desktop\Guess5\backend\guess5-escrow

# Set HOME environment variable
$env:HOME = $env:USERPROFILE

# Try building
anchor build
```

### Option 3: Manual Deployment

Use the existing `program.so` file and deploy manually:

```bash
# In WSL or PowerShell
solana config set --url devnet
solana airdrop 2  # Get some SOL for deployment
solana program deploy target/deploy/guess5_escrow.so
```

### Option 4: Use the Alternative Script

Run the deployment script I created:

```bash
cd backend
node deploy-existing-program.js
```

## üìã What's Ready

1. **All configuration files updated** with Program ID: `F2Bvxq5bucMFdxAXrwRQd2vGoXdJuddgdPkHwmU3wVx4`
2. **Smart contract source code** is correct and ready
3. **IDL file** is updated with correct Program ID
4. **Backend services** are configured
5. **Deployment configs** are ready for Render/Vercel
6. **Test scripts** are created and working

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Choose one of the solutions above** to build/deploy the smart contract
2. **Deploy to devnet** using your chosen method
3. **Test the deployment** with the test script
4. **Deploy backend to Render** (configuration ready)
5. **Deploy frontend to Vercel** (configuration ready)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If anchor build fails:
- Check that all tools are in PATH
- Verify HOME environment variable is set
- Try building from Windows PowerShell instead of WSL

### If deployment fails:
- Ensure you have SOL in your wallet
- Check network connectivity
- Verify the program binary exists

### If tests fail:
- Verify the Program ID matches across all files
- Check that the program is deployed and executable
- Ensure backend can connect to devnet
