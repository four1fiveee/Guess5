## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue

### Build Environment Problem
- **Issue**: Solana toolchain missing required Rust binaries in WSL
- **Error**: `error: not a file: '/home/four1five/.local/share/solana/install/releases/1.18.4/solana-release/bin/sdk/sbf/dependencies/platform-tools/rust/bin/rustc'`
- **Status**: Blocking smart contract build and deployment

## üîß Solutions Available

### Option 1: Use Windows Deployment Scripts (Recommended)
Since you have Windows Solana and Anchor installations:
1. Open Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator
2. Navigate to `backend\scripts` directory
3. Run either:
   - `deploy-devnet-windows.bat` (Command Prompt)
   - `.\deploy-devnet-windows.ps1` (PowerShell)

### Option 2: Fix WSL Build Environment
If you prefer to continue with WSL:
1. Install Rust: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
2. Reinstall Solana toolchain: `solana-install init v1.18.4`
3. Try building again: `anchor build`

### Option 3: Manual Deployment
Follow the step-by-step instructions in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Choose deployment method** from the options above
2. **Deploy smart contract** to devnet
3. **Note the Program ID** from deployment output
4. **Update environment variables** with actual Program ID

### After Successful Deployment
1. **Update Render backend** with environment variables
2. **Update Vercel frontend** with environment variables
3. **Run database migration**: `npm run migration:run`
4. **Test integration** with small amounts (0.001 SOL)
5. **Monitor system** for 24-48 hours

## üîê Security Information

### Generated Keys
- **Results Attestor Public Key**: `BFJ6CrnhMjr1XPBSMbWkJH5Hq1SfijGP6KiMUqtMGqnN`
- **Results Attestor Private Key**: Stored in `~/.config/solana/results-attestor.json`
- **Wallet**: Configured and funded with 2.69 SOL

### Important Security Notes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never share private keys**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Store results attestor key securely**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test with small amounts first**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Monitor for unexpected behavior**

## üìä Smart Contract Features Ready

Your smart contract is designed to handle all game outcomes:

1. **Player Wins** (5% fee to platform)
2. **Winner Tie** (gas fee only)
3. **Losing Tie** (5% fee from each player)
4. **Timeout** (gas fee only)
5. **Error/Abandoned** (gas fee only)

### Edge Cases Handled
- Partial deposits
- Double deposit prevention
- Unauthorized settlement prevention
- Deadline validation
- Insufficient funds handling

## üöÄ Deployment Commands

### For Windows (Recommended)
```cmd
cd backend\scripts
deploy-devnet-windows.bat
```

### For PowerShell
```powershell
cd backend\scripts
.\deploy-devnet-windows.ps1
```

### For WSL (if build issues resolved)
```bash
cd backend/scripts
node deploy-devnet.js
```

## üìû Support

If you continue to have issues:

1. **Check the troubleshooting section** in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
2. **Try the Windows deployment scripts** (most reliable)
3. **Review error messages** carefully
4. **Ensure all prerequisites** are properly installed

## üéØ Success Criteria

Deployment will be successful when:
- [ ] Smart contract builds without errors
- [ ] Smart contract deploys to devnet
- [ ] Program ID is generated and noted
- [ ] Environment variables are updated
- [ ] Backend and frontend are configured
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] System monitoring is active

---

**Current Status**: Environment setup complete, build environment needs resolution
**Recommended Action**: Use Windows deployment scripts for immediate success
**Next Milestone**: Smart contract deployed to devnet with Program ID
