            <ul className="list-none space-y-1 text-white/80 pl-4">
              <li><strong>1.1 Non-Custodial Platform.</strong> Guess5 is a fully non-custodial platform built on the Solana blockchain. All match funds are held in a 2-of-3 multisignature vault (via Squads Protocol), in which you, your opponent, and the system are co-signers.</li>
              <li><strong>1.2 No Custody or Access.</strong> Guess5 never has unilateral control or custody of user funds and cannot transfer, freeze, seize, or move funds without your cryptographic signature.</li>
              <li><strong>1.3 User-Controlled Payouts.</strong> Match payouts require your active signature. The system cannot process any payout without your participation.</li>
              <li><strong>1.4 Third-Party Smart Contract Infrastructure.</strong> Guess5 relies on smart contracts and infrastructure provided by third parties, including Squads Protocol. Guess5 does not control or guarantee the operation or security of those systems.</li>
              <li><strong>1.5 Blockchain Immutability.</strong> Transactions on Solana are public, immutable, and irreversible once confirmed.</li>

              <li><strong>2.3 Skill-Based Game.</strong> Guess5 is marketed and operated as a skill-based game of knowledge and logic, not chance. Legal interpretations of "skill" may vary by jurisdiction.</li>
              <li><strong>2.4 Prohibited Jurisdictions.</strong> Guess5 is not available in jurisdictions where skill-based, staked, or online gaming for money is prohibited. Use of VPNs, proxies, or location-masking to evade restrictions is strictly prohibited.</li>
